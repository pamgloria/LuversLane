# Luvers Lane
Luvers Lane is a dating website that was created with my partner, Medgine Joseph, as the final project while studying at Generation USA. We wanted something that showcased our creative and artistic personalities.
Currently contains a login and home page.
Consists of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. Backend consists of SpringBoot.

## Work in progress
We are currently working on our about page, timeline page and a backend that connects to our frontend in which you can take a sneak peak of our [backend](https://github.com/pamgloria/LuversLane-BackEnd).
In the future, we would like to be able to allow returning users to actually login in, for new users to signup and for our users to be able to post status that we call "Vibe Checks". Also, we would like to incorporate a direct messaging system in which our users can privately message eachother.
